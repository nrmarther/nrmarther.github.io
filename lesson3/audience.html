                         land and plants as well as to know basic weather information for his day to day.</p>

                    <p class = 'persona'>Susan loves gardening. She plants everything from sunflowers to tomatoes to bell peppers.
                         Her small home in Eugene Oregon is far from family so she treats her plants almost like siblings or neices and nephews.
                         Susan wants a website to tell her when to take care of which plants: when to cover what, when to prep for a heat wave, etc.</p>
